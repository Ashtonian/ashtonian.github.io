# TODO:
Figure out what I want to do...  with this...
Add Blog:

## Blog Topics:
- Guid v implementations and performance comparisons in sql? also CUID?
- int/big int performance of guid or not
- verizo dns hackery proof
- crazy cloud image optimization and delivery
- auto-generate .sln file
- find missing .sln files
- find missing .cs files

## YO DAWG HEARD YOU NEEDED A BLOG

- Built with Jekyll so works with GitHub pages perfect
- Using ruby 2.3.0
- `bundle exec jekyll serve -w` will start localhost:4000 and watch for changes
- May check out [Surge](https://surge.sh/) for hosting, I've loved my experience with it so far. Does require NPM though.

Also

- Chunked font-awesome in favor of [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/) SVG's, cause SVG's are way better.
- Moved normalize into sass folder and include it at the top of main file
- Have blog elements at /blog, can help implement something if you like the way it works!
